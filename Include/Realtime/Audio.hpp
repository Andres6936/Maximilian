    @brief Realtime audio i/o C++ classes.

    RtAudio provides a common API (Application Programming Interface)
    for realtime audio input/output across Linux (native ALSA, Jack,
    and OSS), Macintosh OS X (CoreAudio and Jack), and Windows
    (DirectSound and ASIO) operating systems.

		  \param outputParameters Specifies output stream parameters to use
				 when opening a stream, including a device ID, number of channels,
				 and starting channel number.  For input-only streams, this
				 argument should be NULL.  The device ID is an index value between
				 0 and getDeviceCount() - 1.

				 0 and getDeviceCount() - 1.
		  \param format An RtAudioFormat specifying the desired sample data format.
		  \param sampleRate The desired sample rate (sample frames per second).
		  \param *bufferFrames A pointer to a value indicating the desired
				 internal buffer size in sample frames.  The actual value
				 used by the device is returned via the same pointer.  A
				 value of zero can be specified, in which case the lowest
				 allowable value is determined.
		  \param callback A client-defined function that will be invoked
				 when input data is available and/or output data is needed.
		  \param userData An optional pointer to data that can be accessed
				 from within the callback function.
		  \param options An optional pointer to a structure containing various
				 global stream options, including a list of OR'ed RtAudioStreamFlags
				 and a suggested number of stream buffers that can be used to
				 control stream latency.  More buffers typically result in more
				 robust performance, though at a cost of greater latency.  If a
				 value of zero is specified, a system-specific median value is
				 chosen.  If the RTAUDIO_MINIMIZE_LATENCY flag bit is set, the
				 lowest allowable value is used.  The actual value used is
				 returned via the structure argument.  The parameter is API dependent.
